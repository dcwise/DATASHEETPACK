The Dual-Input Page Program command allows two bits of data to be clocked into the device on every clock cycle rather than just one.</p><p>A Write Enable (WREN) instruction must execute to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit before sending the Dual Input Page Program (DPP). The Dual Input Page Programming takes two pins: SIO0, SIO1 as data input, which can improve programmer performance and the effectiveness of application. The other function descriptions are as same as standard page program.</p><p>The sequence of issuing DPP instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending DPP instruction code→ 3-byte address on SI→at least 1-byte on data on SIO[1:0]→ CS# goes high.</p><p><image href="../images/image131.png" height="134" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-25 Page Program (DPP) Sequence (Command A2)</b></p></body></topic>
