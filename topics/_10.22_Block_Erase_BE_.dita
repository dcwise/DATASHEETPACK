The instruction is used for 64K-byte block erase operation. A Write Enable (WREN) instruction must execute to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit before sending the Block Erase (BE). Any address of the block is a valid address for Block Erase (BE) instruction. The CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary (the latest eighth of address byte been latched-in); otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and not executed.</p><p>The sequence of issuing BE instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending BE instruction code→ 3-byte address on SI→CS# goes high. The SIO[3:1] are "don't care".</p><p>The self-timed Block Erase Cycle time (tBE) is initiated as soon as Chip Select (CS#) goes high. The Write in Progress (WIP) bit still can be checked during the Block Erase cycle is in progress. The WIP sets 1 during the tBE timing, and sets 0 when Block Erase Cycle is completed, and the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset. If the block is protected by BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits, the Block Erase (BE) instruction will not be executed on the block.</p><p><image href="../images/image113.png" height="135" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-22 Block Erase (BE) Sequence (Command D8)</b></p></body></topic>
