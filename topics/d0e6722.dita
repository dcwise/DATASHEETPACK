When the QE bit is set to 0 (Default) the WP# pin and HOLD# pin are enable. When the QE pin is set to 1, the Quad IO2 and IO3 pins are enabled. (The QE bit should never be set to 1 during standard SPI or Dual SPI operation if the WP# or HOLD# pins are tied directly to the power supply or ground)</p></body></topic>
