Before issuing the Resume instruction to restart a suspended erase operation, make sure that there is no Page Program operation in progress.</p><p>Immediately after the Serial NOR Flash receives the Resume instruction, the WEL and WIP bits are set to “1” and the SUS2 or SUS1 is cleared to “0”. The program or erase operation will continue until finished ("Resume to Read Latency") or until another Suspend instruction is received. A resume-to-suspend latency of tPRS or tERS must be observed before issuing another Suspend instruction ("Resume to Suspend Latency").</p><p><image href="../images/image217.png" height="136" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-39 Resume to Read Latency</b></p></body></topic>
