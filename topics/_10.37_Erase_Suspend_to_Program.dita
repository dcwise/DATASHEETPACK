Page Programming is permitted in any unprotected memory except within the sector of a suspended Sector Erase operation or within the block of a suspended Block Erase operation. The Write Enable (WREN) instruction must be issued before any Page Program instruction.</p><p>A Page Program operation initiated within a suspended erase cannot itself be suspended and must be allowed to finish before the suspended erase can be resumed. The Status Register can be polled to determine the status of the Page Program operation. The WEL and WIP bits of the Status Register will remain “1” while the Page Program operation is in progress and will both clear to “0” when the Page Program operation completes.</p><p><image href="../images/image215.png" height="134" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-38 Suspend to Read/Program Latency</b></p></body></topic>
