A Write Enable (WREN) instruction must execute to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit before sending the Sector Erase (SE). Any address of the sector is a valid address for Sector Erase (SE) instruction.	The CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary (the latest eighth of address byte been latched-in); otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and not executed.</p><p>Address bits [Am-A12] (Am is the most significant address) select the sector address.</p><p>The sequence of issuing SE instruction is: CS# goes low → sending SE instruction code→ 3-byte address on SI → CS# goes high.</p><p>The SIO[3:1] are don't care.</p><p><image href="../images/image113.png" height="135" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-20 Sector Erase (SE) Sequence (Command 20)</b></p><p>The self-timed Sector Erase Cycle time (tSE) is initiated as soon as Chip Select (CS#) goes high.	The Write in progress (WIP) bit still can be check out during the Sector Erase cycle is in progress.	The WIP sets 1 during the tSE timing, and sets 0 when Sector Erase Cycle is completed, and the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset. If the sector is protected by BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits, the Sector Erase (SE) instruction will not be executed on the sector.</p></body></topic>
