The GS600X family is designed to provide optimal performance in low voltage and low noise systems. They provide rail-to-rail output swing into heavy loads. The input common mode voltage range includes ground, and the maximum input offset voltage is 3.5mV for GS600X family. They are specified over the extended industrial temperature range (-40℃ to +125℃). The operating range is from 1.8V to 6V. The GS6001 single is available in Green SC70-5 and SOT23-5 packages. The GS6002 dual is available in Green SOP-8 and MSOP-8 packages. The GS6004 Quad is available in Green SOP-14 and TSSOP-14 packages.</p></body></topic>
