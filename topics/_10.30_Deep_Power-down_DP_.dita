The Deep</p><p>Power-down mode requires the Deep Power-down (DP) instruction to enter, during the Deep Power-down mode, the device is not active and all Write/Program/Erase instruction are ignored. When CS# goes high, it's only in standby mode not deep power-down mode. It's different from Standby mode.</p><p>The sequence of issuing DP instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending DP instruction code→ CS# goes high.</p><p>Once the DP instruction is set, all instruction will be ignored except the Release from Deep Power-down mode (RDP) and Read Electronic Signature (RES) instruction. (RES instruction to allow the ID been read out). When Power- down, the deep power-down mode automatically stops, and when power-up, the device automatically is in standby mode. For RDP instruction the CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary (the latest eighth bit of instruction code been latched-in); otherwise, the instruction will not be executed. As soon as Chip Select (CS#) goes high, a delay of tDP is required before entering the Deep Power-down mode and reducing the current to ISB2.</p><p><image href="../images/image171.png" height="134" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-30 Deep Power-down (DP) Sequence (Command B9)</b></p><p>CS#</p><p>SCLK</p><p>0    1    2    3	4    5    6    7</p><p>tDP</p><p>SI</p><p>Deep power-down mode</p></body></topic>
