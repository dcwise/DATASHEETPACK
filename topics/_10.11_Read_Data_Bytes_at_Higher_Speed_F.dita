The address is latched on rising edge of SCLK, and data of each bit shifts out on the falling edge of SCLK at a maximum frequency fC. The first address byte can be at any location. The address is automatically increased to the next higher address after each byte data is shifted out, so the whole memory can be read out at a single FAST_READ instruction. The address counter rolls over to 0 when the highest address has been reached.</p><p>The sequence of issuing FAST_READ instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending FAST_READ instruction code→3-byte address on SI→ 1-dummy byte address on SI→data out on SO→ to end FAST_READ operation can use CS# to high at any time during data out.</p><p>While Program/Erase/Write Status Register cycle is in progress, FAST_READ instruction is rejected without any impact on the Program/Erase/Write Status Register current cycle.</p><p><image href="../images/image76.png" height="135" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-11 Read at Higher Speed (FAST_READ) Sequence (Command 0B)</b></p></body></topic>
