Before it can be accepted, a Write Enable (WREN) command must previously have been executed. After the Write Enable (WREN) command has been decoded and executed, the device sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL).</p><p>The sequence of issuing WRCR instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending WRCR instruction code→ Configure Register data on SI→CS# goes high.</p><p>The CS# must go high exactly at the 8 bits data boundary; otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and not executed. The self-timed Write Status Register cycle time (tW) is initiated as soon as Chip Select (CS#) goes high. The Write in Progress (WIP) bit still can be checked during the Write Status Register cycle is in progress. The WIP sets 1 during the tW timing, and sets 0 when Write Configure Register Cycle is completed, and the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset.</p><p><image href="../images/image67.png" height="134" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-9 Write Configure Register (WRCR) Sequence (Command 31)</b></p></body></topic>
