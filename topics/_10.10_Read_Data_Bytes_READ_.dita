The address is latched on rising edge of SCLK, and data shifts out on the falling edge of SCLK at a maximum frequency fR. The first address byte can be at any location. The address is automatically increased to the next higher address after each byte data is shifted out, so the whole memory can be read out at a single READ instruction. The address counter rolls over to 0 when the highest address has been reached.</p><p>The sequence of issuing READ instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending READ instruction code→ 3-byte address on SI→ data out on SO→ to end READ operation can use CS# to high at any time during data out.</p><p><image href="../images/image71.png" height="137" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-10 Read Data Bytes (READ) Sequence (Command 03)</b></p></body></topic>
