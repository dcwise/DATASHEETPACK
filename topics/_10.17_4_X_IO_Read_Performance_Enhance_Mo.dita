<topic xml:lang="en-US" id="_10.17_4_X_IO_Read_Performance_Enhance_Mo"><title>4 X IO Read Performance Enhance Mode</title><body><p>“EBh” command supports 4 X IO Performance Enhance Mode which can further reduce command overhead through setting the “Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7-0) after the input 3-byte address (A23-A0). If the “Continuous Read Mode” bits (M5-4) = (1, 0), then the next 4 X IO Read command (after CS# is raised and then lowered) does not require the EBH command code.</p><p>If the “Continuous Read Mode” bits (M5-4) do not equal (1, 0), the next command requires the first EBH command code, thus returning to normal operation. A “Continuous Read Mode” Reset command can be used to reset (M5-4) before issuing normal command.</p><p><image href="../images/image107.png" height="135" width="145" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-17 4 x I/O Read Performance Enhance Mode Sequence ( M5-4 = (1,0) )</b></p></body></topic>
