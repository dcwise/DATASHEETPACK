After which, the Manufacturer ID for PUYA (85h) and the Device ID are shifted out on the falling edge of SCLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. If the one-byte address is initially set to 01h, then the device ID will be read first and then followed by the Manufacturer ID. The Manufacturer and Device IDs can be read continuously, alternating from one to the other. The instruction is completed by driving CS# high.</p><p><image href="../images/image205.png" height="136" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-35 QUAD I/O Read Electronic Manufacturer &amp; Device ID (QREMS) Sequence (Command 94)</b></p></body></topic>
