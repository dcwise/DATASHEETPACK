The instruction is used for 32K-byte block erase operation. A Write Enable (WREN) instruction must be executed to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit before sending the Block Erase (BE32K). Any address of the block is a valid address for Block Erase (BE32K) instruction. The CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary (the least significant bit of address byte has been latched-in); otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and not executed.</p><p>The sequence of issuing BE32K instruction is: CS# goes low → sending BE32K instruction code → 3-byte address on SI → CS# goes high.</p><p>The SIO[3:1] are don't care.</p><p>The self-timed Block Erase Cycle time (tBE32K) is initiated as soon as Chip Select (CS#) goes high. The Write in Progress (WIP) bit still can be checked while the Block Erase cycle is in progress. The WIP sets during the tBE32K timing, and clears when Block Erase Cycle is completed, and the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is cleared. If the block is protected by BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1,BP0 bits, the array data will be protected (no change) and the WEL bit still be reset.</p><p><image href="../images/image113.png" height="135" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-21 Block Erase 32K(BE32K) Sequence (Command 52 )</b></p></body></topic>
