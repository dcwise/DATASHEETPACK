A Write Enable (WREN) instruction must execute to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit before sending the Chip Erase (CE). The CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary (the latest eighth of address byte been latched-in); otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and not executed.</p><p>The sequence of issuing CE instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending CE instruction code→ CS# goes high. The SIO[3:1] are "don't care".</p><p>The self-timed Chip Erase Cycle time (tCE) is initiated as soon as Chip Select (CS#) goes high. The Write in</p><p>Progress (WIP) bit still can be checked during the Chip Erase cycle is in progress. The WIP sets 1 during the tCE timing, and sets 0 when Chip Erase Cycle is completed, and the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset. If the chip is protected by BP4,BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits, the Chip Erase (CE) instruction will not be executed. It will be only executed when all Block Protect(BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) are set to “None protected”.</p><p><image href="../images/image117.png" height="137" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-23 Chip Erase (CE) Sequence (Command 60 or C7)</b></p></body></topic>
