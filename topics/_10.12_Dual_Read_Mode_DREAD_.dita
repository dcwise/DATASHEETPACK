The address is latched on rising edge of SCLK, and data of every two bits (interleave on 2 I/O pins) shift out on the falling edge of SCLK at a maximum frequency fT. The first address byte can be at any location. The address is automatically increased to the next higher address after each byte data is shifted out, so the whole memory can be read out at a single DREAD instruction. The address counter rolls over to 0 when the highest address has been reached. Once writing DREAD instruction, the following data out will perform as 2-bit instead of previous 1-bit.</p><p>The sequence of issuing DREAD instruction is: CS# goes low → sending DREAD instruction → 3-byte address on SI → 8-bit dummy cycle → data out interleave on SIO1 &amp; SIO0 → to end DREAD operation can use CS# to high at any time during data out.</p><p>While Program/Erase/Write Status Register cycle is in progress, DREAD instruction is rejected without any impact on the Program/Erase/Write Status Register current cycle.</p><p><b>Figure 10-12 Dual Read Mode Sequence (Command 3B)</b></p><p><image href="../images/image84.png" height="128" width="141" alt="???"/></p></body></topic>
