The Device ID values are listed in "Table ID Definitions".</p><p>The REMS instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and sending the instruction code "90h" followed by two dummy bytes and one address byte (A7~A0). After which the manufacturer ID for PUYA (85h) and the device ID are shifted out on the falling edge of SCLK with the most significant bit (MSB) first. If the address byte is 00h, the manufacturer ID will be output first, followed by the device ID. If the address byte is 01h, then the device ID will be output first, followed by the manufacturer ID. While CS# is low, the manufacturer and device IDs can be read continuously, alternating from one to the other. The instruction is completed by driving CS# high.</p><p><image href="../images/image193.png" height="125" width="494" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-33 Read Electronic Manufacturer &amp; Device ID (REMS) Sequence (Command 90)</b></p></body></topic>
