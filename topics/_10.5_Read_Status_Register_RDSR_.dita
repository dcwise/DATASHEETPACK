The Read Status Register can be read at any time (even in program/erase/write status register condition). It is recommended to check the Write in Progress (WIP) bit before sending a new instruction when a program, erase, or write status register operation is in progress. For command code “05H”, the SO will output Status Register bits S7~S0. The command code “35H”, the SO will output Status Register bits S15~S8</p><p>The sequence of issuing RDSR instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending RDSR instruction code→ Status Register data out on SO. The SIO[3:1] are "don't care".</p><p><image href="../images/image56.png" height="135" width="143" alt="???"/><b>Figure 10-5 Read Status Register (RDSR) Sequence (Command 05 or 35)</b></p></body></topic>
