When the DP bit is set to 0 (Default) the page size is 256bytes. When the DP pin is set to 1, the page size is 512bytes.</p><p>This bit controls the page programming buffer address wrap point. Legacy SPI devices generally have used a 256 Byte page programming buffer and defined that if data is loaded into the buffer beyond the 255 Byte location, the address at which additional bytes are loaded would be wrapped to address zero of the buffer. The P25Q80L provides a 512 Byte page programming buffer that can increase programming performance. For legacy software compatibility, this configuration bit provides the option to continue the wrapping behavior at the 256 Byte boundary or to enable full use of the available 512 Byte buffer by not wrapping the load address at the 256 Byte boundary. When the DP pin is set to 1, the page erase instruction (81h) will erase the data of the chosen Dual Page to be "1".</p></body></topic>
