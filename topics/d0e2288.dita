If the timing in the figures is ignored, the device will not operate correctly.</p><p>During power-up and power-down, CS# needs to follow the voltage applied on VCC to keep the device not to be selected. The CS# can be driven low when VCC reach Vcc(min.) and wait a period of tVSL.</p><p><b>Figure 5-8	AC Timing at Device Power-Up</b></p><p><image href="../images/image30.png" height="356" width="115" alt="???"/></p><p><b>Figure 5-9 Power-up Timing</b></p><p><image href="../images/image34.png" height="128" width="136" alt="???"/></p></body></topic>
